    this function should load your images as a numpy array

    The images are stored as "Raw" files. There are many ways how to load a raw images.
    Do a google research, there are many resources that will help you.
    
    You can e.g. use np.fromfile. However, this gives only a 1D-array back, hence you have to
    resize it after
    
    All information that you need for the images hrer are the following:
    
    Size of images that are used in this assignemnt are: 600 x 800
    Dtype of Raw images: np.uint8
    
    You can use e.g. the glob function with the wildcard (*) parameter to get a list of
    only the raw files. Then you only have to iterate through this list and load each image and
    store it.
